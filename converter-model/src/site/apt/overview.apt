OCR model

  The model contained in this module is a representation of a generic OCR document. It consists of typical elements that
  make up a document, like pages, paragraphs, images, words, and characters. The specific characteristic of an OCRed document
  is that many of its elements can have coordinates which define the position on the page. 
  
Implementation

  The OCR model is defined in an XML Schema document. JAXB is used to generate Java classes that correspond to the 
  model elements. The classes are used in the other modules of this project.
